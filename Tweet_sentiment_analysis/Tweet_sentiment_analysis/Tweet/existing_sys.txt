The present work on sentiment analysis can be categorised from a variety of 
angles, including the method employed, the perspective on the text, the 
amount of text analysis detail, the rating level, etc.
We identified machine learning, lexicon-based, statistical, and rule-based 
techniques from a technological perspective.
By training on a known dataset, the machine learning method employs different
learning algorithms to ascertain the sentiment. The lexicon-based method 
involves determining a review's emotion polarity based on the semantic 
orientation of its words or sentences. A text's subjectivity and viewpoint 
are measured by its "semantic orientation."
The rule-based technique scans a document for opinion words before 
classifying it according to the proportion of positive and negative words.
It takes into account a variety of classification criteria, including 
dictionary polarity, negation and boosting words, idioms, emoticons, and 
mixed viewpoints, among others.
Each review is represented by statistical models as a combination of 
latent features and ratings.
In order to cluster head words into aspects and sentiments into ratings, 
it is believed that aspects and their ratings can be represented by 
multinomial distributions. Another categorization is focused primarily 
on the organisation of the text: classification at the document, phrase, 
or word level. Sentence- or word-level classification can express a 
sentiment polarity for each sentence in a review or even for each word, as 
opposed to document-level classification, which seeks to identify a 
sentiment polarity for the entire review. According to our research, the 
majority of approaches concentrate on the document-level.
Additionally, we may distinguish between techniques that aim to score a 
review globally versus techniques that gauge the strength of sentiment for 
various parts of a product. Most approaches to global review classification
 that depend on machine learning simply take into account the polarity of 
the review (positive/negative) into account. More linguistic variables, 
such as intensification, negation, modality, and discourse structure, are 
used in solutions that aim for a more precise classification of reviews 
(such as three or five star ratings). A thorough classification 
of existing approaches is shown in Figure 1. This grouping is not 
exhaustive. One solution can be used in multiple categories.
